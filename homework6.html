  <h2>Scared expression</h2>

</p> For my illustrated eye, I tried to convey the emotion of fear. I placed the iris very close to the tearducts, which makes the eye seem like it's focused on something, and then I used uniform circles to make the eye seem wide-open (shocked / frightened vibe), and finally I added some veins / blood vessels surrounding part of the iris, which I thought gave-off a feeling of stress or anxiety, and that combined with the other elements makes the eye look somewhat frightened. </p>

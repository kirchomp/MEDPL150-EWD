<h1>Image 2</h1>

<img src="homework 2 images/image-no2.jpg" width="80%">
   <p>This piece is similar to my first photo in the long-exposure style, but I included ONLY my hand, moving over the top of a bench. The effect was cool, but again, the original photograph was a bit overexposed, washed out. So in Photoshop, I added a Levels and a Curves adjustment layer so that my hand was more visible in the frame. It had an effect I didn't predict though, with the texture of the bench becoming more graphic and contrasted in the edited version compared to the original.</p>

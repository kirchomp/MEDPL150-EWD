   <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For my cut-up-cinema GIF, I wanted to recreate a sequence of a horse running. I used the puppet-warp tool to adjust the horse's legs, head, back, and tail, to create the illusion of movement or running. In the end, my frame-animation looked pretty bad, almost like the horse was doggy-paddling in water. So I decided at the last minute to add some water behind the horse and call it a swimming horse. Ridiculous.</p>

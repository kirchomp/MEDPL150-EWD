   <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For my data collection, I asked 25 random Hunter students (they had to be Hunter students, if someone told me they were faculty or staff, I emitted them from the survey results) questions as they entered the building of the West lobby. I asked them 4 questions about their typical commute to Hunter.</p>

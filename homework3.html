<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Although I’m somewhat familiar with camera aperture / f-stops, I found it kind of difficult to get two properly-exposed images with different apertures at nighttime and outside, which is where I took the photos. I did end-up increasing the ISO a lot in order to brighten the image, and the digital grain is noticeable, but not distracting. In photoshop, using the field-blur to create an artificial shallow depth-of-field was fun because I’ve never experimented with that tool. I put-down many ‘points’ of field blur and I think it ended-up blurring my subject’s arm slightly, but the effect does seem to create a nice background blur. I feel like I could use the field-blur tool ALL the time now that I’ve been shown it. 

For my before /after RAW photos, I really liked the composition of the photos I took, but both were very underexposed. There’s definitely a time and a place for making cool-looking, underexposed images for that grittier / darker look, but in this case, my two images were simply unintriguing because of the level of light. Using the camera raw editor, I increased the brightness and contrast dramatically, and even added some grain. I love the idea of taking photos in RAW, the quality and editing capabilities are inspiring, but the file-size, not so much!</p>

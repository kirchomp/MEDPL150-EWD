<h1>Elijah Wheat-Dardano</h1>

  
</p>Elijah W-D is a multi-disciplinary artist from upstate NY, now living in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. It can be very challenging for him to hone-in on any ONE specific medium or material when making work. It can also be hard for him to determine what the ‘goal’ is when starting a piece. While tons of his art is driven by a simple, almost therapeutic need, where the process itself is the goal (one of relaxation and happy busy-work), other times it’s to reach an audience and share images, phrases, and emotions, that are hyper-specific to this day-and-age.<p>

  
</p>Taking into account the different limitations and advantages between physical and digital media, He enjoys jumping back-and-forth between them and sometimes combining elements of both. 
When he creates physical work, his focus is making prints on t-shirts (cyanotypes, screenprints, heat-transfers), collaging, abstract acrylic painting, making zines, videography and photography. On the digital side, he loves the process of editing photos (distorting/manipulating them too), creating graphic designs, and editing video to create both narrative and abstract video-art and short films.<p>

  
</p>There is no real cohesive style across his pieces, his interest in other potential art-mediums only grows more as he learns more, and he is constantly overwhelmed by a sea of inspiration & abundance of choice. He soon needs to narrow-down his ‘top priorities’ and spend a good bit of time getting better at them… but for now, he experiments across lots of different mediums to learn as much as possible.<p>

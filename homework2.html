  <p>Something that I've always wanted to experiment more with with photography is long exposures. For this photo, I used a tripod to maintain a steady camera so that the background wouldn't be blurry, but anything that moved after I clicked the shutter would be. I used myself as a model but decided to not include my face in the original photograph, to add a bit of mystery and intrigue. The original photo was a bit overexposed, so in Photoshop, I added a curves adjustment layer and increased the contrast & saturation.</p>

  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's 'On photography'</h2>
  <p>It’s a bit wild to think that Susan Sontag wrote what she did about photography and image making in relation to Plato’s Cave in 1977, when it seems so especially pertinent to contemporary society today. In the first chapter of her book, On Photography, Sontag explains that similar to the people trapped in the cave, people in our modern society have become enthralled or mesmerized with photographic images, and in turn, mistake them for ‘the truth’ or for reality. Sontag explains that there’s an innate power that a camera and/or photographic images have over a viewer, and therefore over society. They shape the viewer’s perception of what reality is, what the world is, and also what sights, objects, and / or events are considered ‘photo-worthy’. When I reflect on the ways in which I make images, and the reasons why I enjoy it so much, there’s definitely parts of what Sontag is saying that ring true for me. One of my biggest motivators for photographing things is for memory’s sake. I want to remember exactly what something looked like, or to capture a precise moment so that I can look back on it and remember the EXACT emotions I had at that specific moment. The experiences I want to photograph and therefore remember can sometimes be quite simple, even maybe boring for others to look at, but other times it’s my grandest adventures and most exciting days. Sontag touches on this same idea by discussing tourism and its relationship to the camera / photographs. She explains that traveling, in a way, has become ‘a strategy for accumulating photographs’ and that people like to put a camera in between themselves and the actual world, as a feeling of comfort. I relate to this all-too-well. But another significant reason why I like to make images is for their selective nature; for artistic purposes. Choosing how to frame a shot, what to include in the foreground / background, the emotion I hope to elicit from the person who sees it, are all part of a sort of manipulation of the viewer and how they see reality. By choosing how to present the world, I in turn influence other people’s perception of it. This comes back around to what Sontag was saying about the innate power of images. The world can be perceived in such different, polarizing ways, depending on who the viewer is, and to shape another person’s view of reality in accordance with your own via images, is an assertion of power over them. According to Sontag, there’s also a power specific to photographing people. By photographing someone, their existence is captured and placed into an object that can be literally or symbolically owned by somebody else. This reductionary practice comes with a certain power-struggle between the subject and the artist (or image-maker) but now seems commonplace in society. In my opinion, the best photos don’t have a strong sense of manipulation or don’t ask the viewer to look at something in a specific planned way, but invite them to reflect on how they’d LIKE to see it, how they’d LIKE to interpret a sliver of this here reality.
